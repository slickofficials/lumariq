# LUMARIQ CANON (Single Source of Truth)

Nigeria-first 🇳🇬 → Benin 🇧🇯 → Ghana 🇬🇭 → Africa → Global.

Lumariq is a continental OS:
- L0 Trust+Value: identity, KYC/KYB, AML, wallets/cards/escrow, credit, audit
- L1 Commerce+Movement: marketplace, POS, inventory, dispatch, rides, fleets, logistics
- L2 Intelligence: fraud/risk, demand/price, FX/inflation, forecasting
- L3 Agents: WhatsApp bots, copilots, workflows, escalation + human override
- L4 Governance: utilities, health, education, safety, compliance
- L5 NEURON GRID: cross-layer orchestration + shock absorber + optimization

Rules:
- Append-only functions list (deprecate, don’t delete)
- Everything is events + ledger
- Idempotency everywhere
- Country packs (config) not forks

---

## Country Packs
- Nigeria (NG) is the reference implementation
- No forks — all countries load config
- Payments, limits, compliance are config-driven
